# Project Progress

*   **2025-05-16:** Resolved AR_GROUP_HEADER identification issue for multiple 'Format' columns in the Streamlit app.
    *   Refactored the logic in `streamlit_app.py` to correctly determine `ar_cols_start_idx`.
    *   Successfully identifies 'Aspect Ratio' when present and correctly selects the second 'Format' column as the start of the AR group if multiple 'Format' columns exist.
    *   Verified the application generates the target 240 unique creative combinations from the `Haleon CEJ Master Spec Sheet 3.1.xlsx` file via detailed console log analysis across all platforms.
*   **2025-05-15:** Successfully created a distributable executable version of the Excel transformation tool.
    *   Packaged using PyInstaller in "one-folder" mode.
    *   Integrated a splash screen for improved startup UX.
    *   Resolved various PyInstaller build issues related to UPX, icons, and command syntax.
    *   The final executable is named `ExcelTransformer.exe` and located in `dist/ExcelTransformer/`.
*   **Previous:** Core script logic for Excel data transformation, validation, and GUI (tkinter dialogs) implemented and functional.
