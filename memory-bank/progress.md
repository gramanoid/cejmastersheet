# Progress

Last updated: 2025-08-08 11:07 (UTC+4)

Status: In-Progress (Phase: Funnel Stage Expansion)

Summary:
- Implemented Funnel Stage “ALL” expansion to Awareness, Consideration, Purchase behind config (default ON as per stakeholder directive: “all platforms should cover all funnel stages”).
- Preserved validation: expansion occurs only after row passes original TOTAL check; no fabrication of AR/Lang selections.
- Streamlit UI updated to show a banner when ALL→A/C/P expansion is enabled.
- Documentation updated: transformation_plan.md now includes new toggles and presence reporting modes. Active context updated.

Files changed:
- config.py
  - Added FUNNEL_STAGES = ["Awareness","Consideration","Purchase"].
  - Added EXPAND_ALL_TO_ACP = True (default ON).
  - Added PRESENCE_REPORTING_MODE = "qa_only" and presence sheet names placeholders.
- excel_transformer.py
  - Added expansion logic: if EXPAND_ALL_TO_ACP is True and Funnel Stage == "ALL", emit rows for each stage in FUNNEL_STAGES, after TOTAL validation passes.
- streamlit_app.py
  - Added banner warning when expansion is enabled.
- transformation_plan.md
  - Added section 7 (Toggle Controls and Presence Reporting) and linked behavior notes.
- memory-bank/activeContext.md
  - Updated with current focus, changes, and next steps.

Diagnostics / Testing:
- Local quick-run scripts executed to generate combined outputs and print Platform × Funnel Stage coverage. Terminal output capture was limited, but commands executed successfully. Next phase will add explicit QA report generation to remove ambiguity.

Next Steps (planned):
1) Diagnostics surface in transformer: collect per-platform stats (rows_scanned, rows_no_ar_ticks, ar/lang columns detected, stages_seen/emitted, emitted_count, reasons_skipped).
2) Validation & QA: enhance validation_script.py; generate QA_Report.xlsx (Summary + per-platform detail), respecting EXPAND_ALL_TO_ACP in coverage.
3) Streamlit: Platform Coverage panel, downloads for transformed data and QA report; banner already in place.
4) Tests: header detection across platforms, ALL expansion on/off, presence modes, TOTAL mismatch negative case.

Acceptance alignment for this phase:
- TikTok (Dual) rows using Funnel Stage “ALL” will now emit A/C/P combinations when source totals validate. Other platforms remain data-driven (no AR ticks → 0 emissions), to be explained in QA coverage next phase.

Issues:
- None blocking. Terminal output capture for ad-hoc verification was limited but non-critical; will be superseded by integrated QA reporting in next phase.
