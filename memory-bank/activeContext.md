# Active Context

As of 2025-05-15, the Excel transformation script (`excel_transformer.py`) has been successfully packaged into a user-friendly 'one-folder' executable (`ExcelTransformer.exe`) using PyInstaller.

Key details:
*   **Executable Location:** `dist/ExcelTransformer/ExcelTransformer.exe` (relative to project root).
*   **Build Mode:** One-folder (for faster startup compared to one-file, though pandas initialization is still a factor).
*   **Features:**
    *   Includes a splash screen (`splash_screenv2.png`) for improved user experience during startup.
    *   Uses UPX compression (`--upx-dir .`) for optimizing the size of distributed files.
    *   Windowed application (no console) via `--windowed` flag.
*   **Final successful PyInstaller command:** `pyinstaller --windowed --name ExcelTransformer --upx-dir . --splash splash_screenv2.png excel_transformer.py`
*   **Distribution:** The entire `dist/ExcelTransformer` folder should be zipped and distributed to users. Users run the `.exe` from inside the unzipped folder.

## Active Context for CEJ Master Spec Sheet Transformation (Streamlit App)

**Current Objective:** Refine and debug the Streamlit application for Excel data transformation, ensuring correct header identification and processing to generate 240 unique creative combinations.

**Latest Status:**
*   **RESOLVED:** The critical issue with identifying the Aspect Ratio/Format group header (`ar_cols_start_idx`) for platforms with multiple 'Format' columns (e.g., PROGRAMMATIC, AUDIO, GAMING, AMAZON) has been fixed in `streamlit_app.py`.
*   The application now correctly identifies the primary 'Aspect Ratio' header or falls back to the *second* 'Format' column as appropriate.
*   **VERIFIED:** The application successfully processes the 'Tracker (Dual Lang)' sheet from `Haleon CEJ Master Spec Sheet 3.1.xlsx` and generates the expected **240 unique creative combinations**.
*   All platforms (YOUTUBE, META, TIKTOK, PROGRAMMATIC, AUDIO, GAMING, AMAZON) are processed correctly based on recent console log analysis.

**Key Files Involved:**
*   `streamlit_app.py`: Main application logic (recently modified and verified).
*   `excel_transformer.py`: Core transformation logic (referenced, no recent changes required for this specific issue).
*   `config.py`: Contains configuration constants for headers.
*   `Haleon CEJ Master Spec Sheet 3.1.xlsx`: The input Excel file.

**User Rules/Preferences:**
*   Adherence to Python architecture and Excel data automation best practices.
*   Maintain detailed documentation (issues, progress, plans).
*   One feature/improvement per session.
*   Preserve existing functionality.

**Next Steps (Pending User Confirmation):**
*   Discuss further testing.
*   Consider deployment to Streamlit Community Cloud.
*   Gather user feedback from colleagues.
